==================

This is the course project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data class Nov 2014 session.  

The goal of this project is to create a tidy dataset from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0, which is available here - 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Overview
========
The following files are included in the github repository: 
README.md
CookBook.txt
run_analysis.R
tidyDataActivity.txt
tidyDataSubject.txt
tidyDataActivitySubject.txt

README.md
========
README.md explains the overall purpose of the work and the files included.

CookBook.txt
========
CookBook.txt explains the tidy dataset created and how the analysis was done on the Smartphones datasets.

run_analysis.R
========
run_analysis.R is the R script processing the Smartphones datasets and creating the tidy datasets.  To run run_analysis.R, the Smartphones datasets need to be stored at a directory named UCI which is in the directory as the run_analysis.R file.
Please refer to CookBook.txt to find out the details of the tidy dataset. 

tidyDataActivity.txt
========
This is the tidy dataset that calculates the average value for different mean and standard deviation sensor measurements group by activity labels

tidyDataSubject.txt
========
This the the tidy dataset that calculates the average value for different mean and standard deviation sensor measurements group by subjects

tidyDataActivitySubject.txt
========
This the the tidy dataset that calculates the average value for different mean and standard deviation sensor measurements group by activity labels and then subjects
